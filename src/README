The editor
----------

On the upper three lines of text there are some information about the currently
edited project part.

     Song number                                      Song number in project
                \                                   /

                /                                   \
  Pattern number                                      Pattern sequence in part

The three next lines of text in the editor are editor state and selected pattern
information, on the left-most side of the lines are the editor state information.

    Unused area     Edit mode on/off (E = on, nothing = off)
               \   /
                --/00:Device name      <- The track device number and name

  P = Project   |   The current computer keyboard base octave

           Quantization (steps to jump after a note was added in edit mode)

The next row is more complex do describe the left-most two characters show the
number of rows that the pattern consist of and then there are mapping headers
for note-maps or command-maps, depending on the current track display mode and
instrument configuration:
                                Note-mapped Kick drum
                                |
                                | Note mapped Snare drum

                                                 Compact version of note-mapping

Then the pattern data fills the rest of the screen

That explains it :)

mode only consoles. Hence you will have to rely on your good memory to recall
all the keys that provide you with the requested function you need.
